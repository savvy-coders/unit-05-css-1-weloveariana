# CSS Time 

This time around, we're all about style. Check out the requirements below and alter the index.html content and the style.css content to achieve each of these requirements.

Don't forget to look back at the curriculum and Mozilla Developer Network if you need a refresher on anything.

Challenge:

1. Create a form with a button element in HTML.

2. Change the background color of the form's `body` element to "RGB(233, 233, 233)".

3. Increase the font size of the form's `h1` element to 32 pixels.  

4. Add a 2-pixel solid border to the form's `container` class with the color "RGB(204, 204, 204)".

5. Change the text color of the form's `button` element to "RGB(255, 255, 255)".  

6. Add a 4-pixel border radius to the form's `button` element.

7. Use the :active pseudo-class to change the background color of the button to "RGB(0, 86, 179)" when active/clicked.

Your task is to apply these changes to the provided HTML and CSS files to style the form and button you create.
